# site
ok so this is my website right. it's horrible right. right. you see. actually garbage. i have the Hypertext Markup and Cascading Style experience of a young child in a web design class where nobody knows how to actually design websites. please ignore all of it thank you

fonts and images and also text not included it's just styling and html. like the basic layout

the fonts are from from [the oldschool pc font resource](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/) (really cool site btw) they're not included here because idk if they're Open Sesame but tey are free. the css file still has their names so if you want the exact fonts sure go Grab them. Go Get Them. Only if you want though
